# GEE-Visualizations
This repository showcases visualizations created using Google Earth Engine for specific geospatial tasks. Below are the solutions to each task along with the corresponding screenshots. Please refer to the respective folders for the code and images. 
### Visualizing a Rectangle, Point, and Polygon in GEE
Geometries (Rectangle, Point, line and Polygon) are often used to define regions of interest, boundaries, or areas for spatial analysis and processing.
GEE Script codes for visualizing some specific region are provided in this [link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/08196fc6b496f9fe47533071e9b20c7a) and screenshot of importing these geometries is shown [here](https://github.com/Escobar-is-there/GEE-Visualizations/blob/main/assignment_8(1).png).
### Creating a Feature Collection of Water Bodies
A feature collection is a group or collection of features, each with its own geometry and properties. It allows users to organize and manage multiple spatial features within a single data structure.
GEE Script codes for visualizing five waterbodies of "MIRER KHIL" using feature collection are provided in this [link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/08196fc6b496f9fe47533071e9b20c7a) and screenshot of the GEE interface is also shown [here](https://github.com/Escobar-is-there/GEE-Visualizations/blob/main/assignment_8(2).png).
### GEE Admin Boundaries Visualization
It contains a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script for visualizing administrative boundaries using the 'FAO GAUL: Global Administrative Unit Layers 2015, Second-Level Administrative Units' dataset and focuses on showcasing the boundaries of Bangladesh, Khulna division, and Khulna district.
JavaScript codes for admin boundary visualization in GEE is provided js file [here](https://github.com/Escobar-is-there/GEE-Visualizations/blob/main/Bgd_Boundary.js) and GEE Script [link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/08196fc6b496f9fe47533071e9b20c7a) & screenshot of administrative boundary of "Bangladesh" is given [here](https://github.com/Escobar-is-there/GEE-Visualizations/blob/main/Bangladesh_Boundary.png) and screenshot of the boundary of Khulna
 division and Khulna district is shown [here](https://github.com/Escobar-is-there/GEE-Visualizations/blob/main/Khulna.png).
